* Version 2009.09.12 (DerekChadwick)
============================

the main lesson files and PDFs.

* Version 2009.06.26 (DerekChadwick)
============================

- Added two extra play buttons to the XML file for the expansion and
vocabulary MP3 files.

- Added more URL validation to skip MP3 files with malformed URLs.

- Added lesson validation to skip bad lesson names and extra lessons.

- Added XML validation to remove ampersands that produced invalid XML pages.

* Version 2009.03.22 (jwlee)
============================

  o necessitated by the ChinesePod? site upgrade, significant amounts
of the WLCP code, most notably the parser, have been rewritten
	+ the parser now checks for duplicated vocabulary
	+ the downloader now checks for incorrect lesson names
	+ small changes to the XML format 
  o the WLCP-generated study pages now have
	+ toggle buttons (implemented via JavaScript? and CSS) to
select traditional/simplified Chinese characters, tooltips or pinyin/bopomofo
annotation and show or hide various other textual elements
	+ the pinyin/bopomofo/literal annotations are now implemented
with standard HTML and CSS tables, offering significant speed and
compatibility as a result of not needing the Ruby plugin
	+ links to HTML transcripts
	+ links to generated lesson index 
  o bopomofo table updated to support the ㄩ symbol Changes for new WLCPod

Changes for WLCPod 2009.02.09

Usage note
==========
The entire directory structure has been overhauled since
WeLoveChinesePod 2008.10.19.testing.  Lessons are now stored
(by default) in a sub-folder called "lessons", and the "settings.txt"
file has been replaced by a much more comprehensive "wlcpod.ini" file
that allows for considerable tweaking.

WLCPod also now generates a pretty looking list of downloaded lessons.
By default, these are:
- lessons/wlcpod-index.xml: a list of lessons downloaded the last time
	WLCPod was run
- lessons/wlcpod-master-index.xml: a list of all lessons ever downloaded
	(at least, since switching to this version!)
The idea is that one can simply bookmark these two pages in Firefox, and
then use them as starting pages when searching for WLCPod'ed lessons
instead of manually hunting down directories -- hopefully the lesson
pictures and descriptions make recognizing already studied lessons easier!

As always, things seem to work best under Firefox.

Absent-mindedness fix
=====================

- the file player_mp3_maxi.swf, required for sound support in the WLCPod
	pages, is now actually included

Behavioural changes
===================

- more robust -- doesn't crash with traditional_html is missing or when
	simplified_html misses structure; also, continues on more gracefully
	for a lesson when an individual tab is bad
- better network error handling -- instead of crashing, now retries
	after a socket times out or other urlopen error occurs
- bug fix: get-[tab]-sentence-mp3s options in wlcpod.ini now properly
	control MP3 amalgamation; get-simplified-pdf and get-traditional-pdf
	options now work as well
- includes previously downloaded MP3s when concatenating together to form *-sentences.mp3; also, doesn't crash when an empty MP3 filename in specified in CPod HTML

Interface changes
=================

- fixed punctuation sizes; also now defaults to better font if installed
	("AR PL ZenKai Uni" on Linux and Windows and "BiauKai" on MacOS)
- wlcpod.ini is more readable with better documentation
- can now specify lessons and index files in wlcpod.ini
- rendered WLCPod page now has links to lesson transcript PDFs

Parsing changes
===============

- pronunciation now uses the same spacing as that on ChinesePod's website,
	as some pinyin combinations like yángé cannot be unambiguously
	broken up; as a result, displayed pinyin should also be correct
	(but bopomofo, when enabled, might not be)
- bug fix: in vocabulary sections, fixed problem where incorrect
	traditional characters were found when one pinyin entry occurs
	as a substring of a previous one
